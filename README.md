# Cook

The one activity common to all households in the world, no matter what age, section of society, gender, creed or nationality is cooking. In the world of food, people put aside their differences and gather to enjoy a meal. In today’s scenario, we see food on delivery websites, on people’s instagram/facebook feeds, and on websites where professionals post their recipes.

The problem statement Our team recognizes that a lot of home chefs are developing new recipes, taking aesthetic pictures of their dishes and are sharing them with the world. In the midst of this fast moving and competitive industry, amatuer cooks (homechefs) are having a hard time showcasing their talent. A lot of these home chefs are interested in starting their own small business, however their recipes get lost in the big pool of varied content displayed on social media. Local recipes are getting lost, the talent of home chefs is going unrecognized and is being limited to their households. Gaining recognition from people and potentially starting a catering service (from the comfort of the home kitchen) currently seems like a distant dream.
